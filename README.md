# Weather Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using historical weather data. The goal is to develop a model that can forecast future weather based on various input features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and other meteorological factors.

## Model Architecture:
  An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network was used to capture temporal dependencies in the weather data.
  The model architecture includes:
  Two LSTM layers: The first with 50 units and the second also with 50 units.
  Dense layers for output prediction, with the final layer producing a single value.
